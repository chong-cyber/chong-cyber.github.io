### **About Me**

 <font size="4"> My name is Chong Li and I am currently a second-year MS Biostatistics student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am passionate about making sense of our world through a data-driven lens. I will be putting my personal data visualization/analysis projects on this site. 
 
Please feel free to look around, and contact me via [email](mailto:cl4045@cumc.columbia.edu) at if you have any questions/advice. Thanks for coming by!</font>

```

### **Fun Facts**

<font size="4"> In addition to data science, I am a big aviation fan and plan on getting my private pilot license once I start working! My favorite aircrafts are Van's Aircraft's RV-7 and Daher's TBM-940.</font>
