### **Introduction**

My name is Chong Li and I am currently a second-year MS Biostatistics student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am passionate about making sense of our world through a data-driven lens. I will be putting my personal data visualization/analysis projects on this site. Please feel free to look around, and contact me via email if you have any questions/advice. Thanks for coming by!

knitr::include_graphics(c("./images/profile.pic.venice.jpg"))
```

### **Fun Facts**

In addition to data science, I am a big aviation fan and plan on getting my private pilot license once I start working! My favorite aircrafts are Van's aircraft's RV-7 and Daher's TBM-940.
