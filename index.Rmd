### Introduction

My name is Chong Li and I am currently a second year MS Biostatistics student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am passionate about making sense of our world through a data-driven lens. I will be putting my personal data visualization/analysis project on this site. Please feel free to look around, and contact me via email if you have any questions/advice!

### Fun Facts

In addition to data science, I am a big fan of aviation and plan on getting my private pilot license once I start working! My favorite aircraft are Van's aircraft's RV-7 and Daher's TBM-940.
